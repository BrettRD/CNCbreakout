Estop logic not complete
	interrupts the active enable lines on each servo using optocouplers
	optos are TCMT1108 4pin open collector by Vishay $0.2 next day at E14
	Need to route an estop signal to the PC
Cables:
	Enable lines are routed via the breakout board
	Pinout not finalised
	DE15 and DE9 pcb connectors are by Oupiin available at altronics drawn from datasheet

PCB layout:
	Need to plan cable placement
